NOTES

* Stevie doesn't like the repetitive adding to total in chance!
* Every method has the same parameters which are ALL FIVE die.
* We don't often see a 'y' in code!
* Why are there 9 counts in `score_pair`? 
* So many small inconsistencies! (tallies, t, counts, etc.)
* Using `var` - lots of reassignment and mutation, some `let`s
* Why are there so many random methods that aren't being used.
* static v instance methods - should pick one. Neither? Abstraction?
* can we wrestle d1...d5?
* TWL: rest is the opposite of spread
